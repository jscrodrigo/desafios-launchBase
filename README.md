## ⚕️ IMC
Basically the IMC calculates if a person is overweight or not, by doing:
`weight/(height*height)`

## 👵🏾 👴🏿 Retirement Calculation
Here in Brazil, until a few years ago, some factors that allowed a person to ask for retirement were:
- If Male:
  * Contibution time should be `>= 35 years`
  * Contribution time + age should be `>= 95 years`
- If Female:
  * Contribution time should be `>=30 years`
  * Contribution time + age should be `>= 85 years`
