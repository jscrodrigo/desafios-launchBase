# About
This respository is dedicated to the challenges of the Rocketseat LaunchBase course.
- In the first one I show You how to calculate the IMC of a person and how to discover if one is able
to retire or not, given its sex, age and contribution time!
- In the second one is presented how to declare and log to the console objects and arrays.

## ⚕️ IMC
Basically the IMC calculates if a person is overweight or not, by doing:
`weight/(height*height)`

## 👵🏾 👴🏿 Retirement Calculation
Here in Brazil, until a few years ago, some factors that allowed a person to ask for retirement were:
- If Male:
  * Contibution time should be `>= 35 years`
  * Contribution time + age should be `>= 95 years`
- If Female:
  * Contribution time should be `>=30 years`
  * Contribution time + age should be `>= 85 years`
